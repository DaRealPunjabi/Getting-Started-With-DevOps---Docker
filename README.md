Docker simplifies the process of creating, deploying and running applications by using containers.

A container is a runnable instance of an image made up of the application along with other parts such as libraries and other dependencies as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient package.

It allows multiple containers to run on the same hardware and provides high productivity, along with maintaining isolated applications and facilitating seamless configuration.
